We were assigned the paper \textit{CNN-based fast source device identification}\ref{AA} by, \textit{Mandelli et al.}

In this paper the authors propose a CNN-based approach to address the problem of source device identification based on PRNU. 
In particular, their goal is to replace the PCE test with an alternative method based on CNN.

The core idea of this paper is to use a 2-channel CNN to compare the estimated device PNRU $K_d$ with the noise residual $W$ 
obtained from the given test image $I$.
First of all they estimate the device PRNU $K_d$ from a set of flat-field images taken from the same device and they extract the
noise residual $W$ from a set of images depicting natural scenes.
Then they crop the central $P$x$P$ pixel region from both $K_d$ and $W$ and they feed the CNN with these 2 image patches.
The CNN is composed of
